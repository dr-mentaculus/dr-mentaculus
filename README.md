<b>More about me</b>

I am a former Associate Professor of Philosophy, pivoting to a career in Data Science. I taught philosophy for 13 years at Lingnan University, in Hong Kong, first as an assistant professor, and then later as an associate professor with substantiation (the Hong Kong version of tenure). After the political disturbances and the pandemic, my family and I decided it was important to live closer to extended family. So it was time to move back to the U.S. Jobs in academia being as scarce as they are, though, this has also meant a career change. I've been teaching myself Data Science, both through books and also through online sources like Coursera and Codecademy.

I really enjoy coding--which I've been doing now for about a year. And I find a lot of the concepts in statistics and probability fascinating. So if you have recommendations on learning more of that, let me know.
