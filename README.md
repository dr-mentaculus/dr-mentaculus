<b>More about me</b>

I am a former Associate Professor of Philosophy, pivoting to a career in Data Science. I taught philosophy for 13 years at Lingnan University, in Hong Kong, first as an assistant professor, and then later as an associate professor with substantiation (the Hong Kong version of tenure). After the political disturbances and the pandemic, my family and I decided to move back to the U.S. Jobs in academia being as scarce as they are, though, this has also meant a career change. I've been teaching myself Data Science, both through books and also through online sources like Coursera and Codecademy.

You can check out my public repositories here for examples of what I've taught myself to do.
